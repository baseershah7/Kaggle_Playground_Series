# Kaggle Playground Series (S4 + S5)

This repository contains my complete participation in the **Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4 & 5)**. Each folder contains my experiments, notebooks, and approaches for the corresponding episode. Most notebooks are complete E2E pipelines, ranging from baseline models to AutoML/Optuna optimization, ensemble learning, and model stacking.

>  I participated in over **13 Playground Competitions** and still counting, consistently placing in the top 10‚Äì20% in many of them.
